    "# Causal analysis in drug evaluation\n",
    "This notebook shows how causal inference can be used to resolve an instance of Simpson's paradoxon. It is based on a great exercise in Judea Pearl's book \"Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer\". The used data describes an observational study where all patients suffer from the same illness. We are tasked with finding out the effectiveness of a drug that some of the patients have been prescribed. Curiously, the drug seems to help both the male and the female subpopulations, but in the overall population it seems to inhibit recovery. Should we recommend the use of the drug to a random patient? To a man? To a woman?"
